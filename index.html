        <h1 class="mb-3">Anthony Camarena
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Executive ManagementðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My Name is Anthony Camarena I am currently a Pre-Business student at the University of California Riverside. Some of my hobbies include playing sports such as soccer, playing video games, and playing musical instruments. I am currently playing in two bands named Desolation and Aura as both lead singer and lead guitarist. I have worked three jobs, one as a lead chef in a fast food restaurant franchise, another cleaning buses, and lastly another for a company who helped clean the environment.Currently I am working towards becoming the owner and CEO of popular record store Amoeba Records. I have always loved music growing up being surrounded by it my entire childhood as my uncle played the accordion and my dad loved to always play music. Therefore, growing it only became natural that I began to play music and surround myself with music. As a result I am working hard to become the CEO in hopes to make new innovative changes to the record store that could draw in new and old customers. In addition, I would like to expand the company all across America and hope to spread live music to lots of people all around the world to share the same love of music that I have.<br><br>

        One of these changes that I would like to do is to have bands play live music within the record store at certain times in order to connect with the youth and draw in more people. This is especially important as it's something that I can especially relate to since I also play in bands. Therefore, by creating a relationship between the store and bands the store is also creating a relationship with the store and customers. However, while I generally have an understanding of how jobs work as I have worked three jobs throughout my high school career. I am hoping to develop my knowledge of how and what goes into the actual side of business rather than just the easy parts. Therefore I plan to earn a masters degree in marketing after earning a bachelor's degree in marketing at the University of California Riverside. In addition, I plan to take many internships and other opportunities to help develop my management skills in order to make Amoeba Records the most successful Record store franchise in the world.<br><br>

        Therefore I am working hard to spread the love of music with people in hopes of bringing people together through music creating new friendships and bonds. I want to give bands the opportunity to be able to put their music out there and demonstrate to other people who will like it. I want people to create bonds that could last a lifetime through a common interest in music. I want to hire people to work at the record store who have just as much passion for music as I do so that they can really connect to the customers and not just be seen as an employee but a friend as we are just like them in the sense that we like music as well.
